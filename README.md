#NOOBjs Ember Components

This is a library for demonstrating the usage of some fun JavaScript libraries to build components to use in your Ember app. Currently, it includes Chart.js and Leaflet.js, but I hope to include other libraries like D3, Moment.js, CreateJS, and others.

##About Me

I'm a full-stack JavaScript developer who loves working with Node and Ember, and pretty much anything JavaScript. I love helping others understand JavaScript and have a special spot in my heart for noobs. Check out my website at [NOOBjs.org](noobjs.org).
